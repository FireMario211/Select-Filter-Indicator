# Select Filter Indicator
Have you ever had a moment where you enter the editor and try selecting some objects, only to find that nothing is being selected?  
And then after like 10 wasted minutes you find out that GD saved your previously selected custom select filter from your delete tab?  
  
No? Just me? Well, I made this mod anyways.

## Don't know about the custom select filter?
**If you have the "select filter" checkbox on in the editor pause menu,** you can use filters from the delete tab to SELECT objects!  
This means you can make the game ONLY select ONE specific object type, which is really useful for selecting underneath details and glow.  
***Wulzy has a [Great Mini-Tutorial](https://youtu.be/aGrNcYJF5LU?si=OrBmIFIyf-6gYwfL) showing how to turn it on and use it.***

# Mod Features
- Adds an indicator for when you have a custom object select filter enabled in the delete tab.
- Indicate the other types of filters aside from ones for specific individual objects. ***(Note: these can only be used to DELETE objects, not select.)***
